# MDD App front


The Frontend is based on Angular version  19.2.5.
It uses Angular Material as UI library.



# Setup

## Prerequisites

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jceintrey/mdd.git

Install the dependencies

```bash
cd front
npm i
```

## Running the application

To run the whole application, consider the Backend should be started to make the front working as expected.
